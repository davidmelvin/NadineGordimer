				<p>I like the warm color in the site. The interface for your website if fluid, manageable, and unique as compared to the others that I have seen so far. I think that you could have included more information about the society that Nadine Gordimer grew up in. Besides this one qualm, job well done!</p>

				<p>considering you made this with html, it mightve been slightly harder than making it with a website that helps with every step, it came out really nice :) information to pictures and everything...and what's a bub?</p>
