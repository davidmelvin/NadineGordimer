		<p class="grid_6" >Nadine Gordimer was born on November 1923, near Springs, South Africa. Early in her life, she wanted to be a dancer, but her mother stopped her because Nadine had a heart condition. Later, she was pulled out of school for this minor condition, and Nadine began to read and write. She wrote about the things she was exposed to in her society, and that included Apartheid.</p>
